1) Choose ne, sw gps coordinates from google maps. Add to "GPS coordinates.csv"
2) Main interface is "generate_project_gcodes_2024.py". Utilities are stored in appropriate utils_##.py functions.

3) Using generate_project_gcodes_####.py: Set model dimensions and rotation, create satellite map
4) Created a master svg file in inkscape:
	Set dimensions to same as model. Change units to mm and scale to 1 in document properties. 
	Import satellelite map. 
	Trace lines pen tool.
	Add mountain logo, signature, and text.

5) Generating gcodes with generate_project_gcodes_2024.py.
	Change roughing/smoothing properties as desired.
	Will generate gcode for paths, not images and text
	Images and text can be imported into lasergrbl individually. Then converted to gcode with heights.
